GILDED ROSE

_Description
Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison.
We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date.

_Items
CHECK: “Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets

CHECK: “Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality

WIP: “Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as it’s SellIn value approaches; 
      Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less 
      but Quality drops to 0 after the concert

_Item Facts
CHECK: All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
CHECK: All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
CHECK: At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
CHECK: Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
CHECK: The Quality of an item is never negative
CHECK: The Quality of an item is never more than 50
